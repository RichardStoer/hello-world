Hi, I am new to this process. I have been programming for years. Starting in RPG (Report Program Generator) in 1975 until 2011 in RPG-Free.  That was when I wound up on disability and was no longer working.
I have decided to try to learn some new ways of doing the stuff I used to do.  But using newer tools and such.
